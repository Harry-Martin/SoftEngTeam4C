            Programming Applications and Programming Languages</h2>
        <h3 class="module-discription">
            The first part of this module builds on students' existing programming skills by 
            covering concepts and techniques relevant to the construction of complex interactive 
            software applications, including object-oriented polymorphism, exception handling, 
            event-driven programming and user interface development. The second part explores 
            programming language design and implementation concepts including language evaluation, 
            syntax specification, compilation, control structures, memory allocation and abstraction 
            mechanisms. The learning outcomes aim at achieving the graduate hallmark of having a 
            critical and reflective knowledge and understanding of the subject, thinking independently, 
            analytically and creatively, and being able to synthesise new and existing knowledge 
            to generate ideas and develop creative solutions.

            Software Engineering Theory and Practice</h2>
        <h3 class="module-discription">
            This module introduces the process and managerial issues of producing large 
            and complex software. The module covers aspects of software development such 
            as planning, requirements engineering, software design, collaborative coding, 
            software testing. It also discusses the adoption of software engineering in specific 
            industries such as the auto industry, game industry, as well as the implications of 
            developing software for safety critical systems without careful consideration of the 
            best practices in software engineering. The module requires students to work in teams and 
            develop a medium size software system, putting in place and documenting a process model of 
            their choice as part of a 5-deliverable coursework. They will have the chance to peer review 
            each others deliverables throughout the year, and be critical and reflective of the process 
            they themsleves put in place.

            Discrete Mathematics And Functional Programming</h2>
        <h3 class="module-discription">
            This module covers mathematical concepts relevant to software engineering 
            and computer science, and introduces the student to the practice of functional 
            programming and its underlying mathematical foundations.
